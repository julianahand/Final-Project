# Horrendoma
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
We interpreted the theme Every Death Counts as in everyone who dies leaves something meaningful behind. The player is in a run-down hospital being chased by lost souls. Despite being a threat to the player, the undead patients were once victims themselves. By escaping the hospital, the player is able to live on with the memories of those who are no longer with us.

## Game Play
Escape the hospital alive.
Use the arrow keys to move your character through the building and avoid enemies.

## Impediments
Issues with implementation of skinning within Blender and solely virtual collaboration. When trying to merge different branches together, problems would arise such as the player falling through the floor or the pause menu being deleted.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3 and Blender 2.92.0

## References
Inspired by "Outlast" by Red Barrels

## Future Development
Furnish the hospital and add mementos from the deceased patients to collect.
