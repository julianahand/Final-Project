# Horrendoma
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2021

## Theme
We interpreted the theme Every Death Counts as in everyone who dies leaves something meaningful behind. The player is in a run-down hospital being chased by lost souls. Despite being a threat to the player, the undead patients were once victims themselves. By escaping the hospital, the player is able to live on with the memories of those who are no longer with us.

## Game Play
Escape the hospital alive.
Use the arrow keys to move your character through the building and avoid enemies.

## Impediments
Issues with implementation of skinning within Blender. Challenges collaborating through solely virtual coommunication. When trying to merge different branches together, problems would arise such as the player falling through the floor or the pause menu being deleted. We underestimated the severity of the time constraint compared to our ambitions with the project.

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3 and Blender 2.92.0, WASD mappings

Wall, floor and ceiling textures were downloaded from cc0textures.com

Fonts "FreckleFace-Regular" and "ZillaSlab-Regular" were downloaded from Google Fonts

Coin sound effect by Free-Rush on freesound.org

All Music by Patrick de Arteaga (patrickdearteaga.com)

Other assets were downloaded from kenney.nl

## References
Inspired by "Outlast" by Red Barrels

## Future Development
Furnish the hospital and add mementos from the deceased patients to collect.
